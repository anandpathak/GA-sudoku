# GA-Sudoku
An Attempt to solve Sudoku problem  using a genetic algorithm in python
`
# Details

  - generate valid sudoku using graph coloring technique.
  - Eliminate some of the values from the sudoku and generate different level of problem sudokus
  - Pass problem Sudoku to the Genetic algorithm. 
> Initial Sample
 - Initially, sample spaces are generated by picking the values allowed to a position, and if no valid value is possible then pick a random value.
> Fitness calculation
 - Fitness is calculated based on the incorrectness caused by each position. Instead of scoring the sample, each position of the samples is scored.  
> Selection 
 - Based on the probability (calculated from the score) of each position, positions are chosen for the next generation. 

Numpy and Python are required to run the project.

# Run
```
